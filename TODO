## john notes

more of a data anlysis tool

### quantifying turnaround time

by reducing turnaround time, encourage experimentation, exploration,
in the old days, wait a week before the chip comes out....turnaround time measured in the order of weeks
here, whats the turnaround time now?
empirical studies that measure improvement in productivity
  - interpreted v compiled
  - livecode versus close-and-restart
analyzing streaming data, particular to the case of connecting to sources..

### can you have the same stream of data fed through multiple functions?

compare between slightly different functions

### physical analogs

firehose model of data
water coming out
you can insert different metal disks that make the water come out in patterns

### databases

can i continuously write into a database

should log the raw stream

#### end users

i just bought some sensor
if i do this, what kind of harmonics might there be from my heartrate 

connects to the interpretation
could be playful, could be informed by something or other
if i take the 3rd derivative of my HRV, multiplied by a second sensor i have, how does it change?

#### higher-dimensional data

this (hr sensor) is one channel 

ok i now have a crazy idea
imagine that i have a haptic suit - 2D array of motos on the back - like a visualization
what if i can drive those motos with my EEG - now i can feel my brainwaves

david eagleman: sensory substitution

> EEG => a stream of matrices of scalars, where each matrix of scalars represents state of the haptic array 

deafness,
if i want to say a word to you
can we convert "apple" onto a haptic array

### one study could be

give people a haptic array
and a sensor (or some sensors)
and have them livecode until they're satisfied
> (and compared to non-livecoding setup (I dont know if we need a control. -- John))
